# Training 2

This is my first markdown post to learn how to work with the Gatsby Framework.
I'm also learning ReactJs and this will be a template to soon be the 'Coming soon' page of my portfolio which is in the works.

## First thoughts and notes boops

We had to install two plugins for gatsby in order to make our life a bit easier.
The first one was 'gatsby-source-filesystem'. This plugin lets us source files into our Gatsby Site through our local filesystem.
We are telling Gatsby that we want to allow GraphQL to query all the insides of assets folder of our project located at specified path
With specifying the directory in the gatsby-config.js file we allow GraphQL to query all the insides of that folder at the specified path.
The second plugin is 'gatsby-transformer-remark' which will parse our markdown into HTML.
